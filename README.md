# github-actions-quickstart

Documentation Feedback-
The documenation was very clear and worked for me without errors. As a newcomer, having taxt that I could simply copy paste as needed was very helpful for getting started. I believe there could be some work done to explain what is going on better however, I did not necessarily know what I was doing and therefore it might be nice if this documentation could be a learning tool for someone like me about github actions.
